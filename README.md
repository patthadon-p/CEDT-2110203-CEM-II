- **`homework-xx/`** → Each homework assignment with its LaTeX file and compiled PDF.  
- **`templates/`** → Common LaTeX macros, environments, or homework style templates. 
- **`code/`** → Any code snippets or Jupyter notebooks used for calculations or plots. 
- **`images/`** → Supporting figures, TikZ diagrams, or plots.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To compile the `.tex` files into PDF, you’ll need:

- **LaTeX distribution** (e.g., [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/), [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/), or Overleaf online)  
- Recommended packages:
  - `amsmath`, `amssymb` (math environments and symbols)
  - `enumitem` (custom lists)
  - `tcolorbox` (solution/problem boxes)
  - `tikz` (diagrams)

To compile the `.py` or `.ipynb` code snippets, you’ll need:
- **Python 3.x** with libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` (if applicable)
  - You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies via:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv/
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- **Jupyter Lab/Notebook** (if using `.ipynb` files)

## ▶️ Compilation

From the terminal:

```bash
cd homework-01
pdflatex main.tex
````

The compiled PDF will appear as `main.pdf`.
